IEOR4501 Group Project
This project analyzes a open dataset provided by the New York City which consists of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services. We analyzed the top 10 causes of calls to 311 in the zip code 10025, and also whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in zip code 10025 than they are in general.
